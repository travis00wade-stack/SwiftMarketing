The AI engineer's work trajectory began by analyzing the user's request to build an SEO-optimized website for a marketing agency, Swift Marketing, incorporating trending services and ClickUp partner status. Initially, the focus was on a full-stack MERN application (React, FastAPI, MongoDB). The AI created a React-only frontend with mock data to provide a quick preview, generating core components and pages like Home, Services, Case Studies, and Contact.

Upon user request, the project pivoted to converting this frontend into a complete WordPress theme. The AI systematically generated standard WordPress theme files (e.g., , , , , , page templates) and integrated features like SEO metadata, mobile responsiveness, and custom post types. User-specific customizations followed, including incorporating the Swift Marketing logo, a hero background image, and specific service images, while ensuring Elementor compatibility and GitHub deployment readiness.

Debugging efforts primarily focused on the WordPress theme. An initial parent theme missing error was resolved by removing an incorrect  line in . The subsequent major issue, which is currently being addressed, involves the WordPress live preview displaying incorrect layout and styling. The AI diagnosed this as a potential issue with front-page loading, CSS inclusion, and missing WordPress-specific utility classes, attempting fixes in , , and .

<current_work>
Currently, the AI engineer is actively working on resolving layout and styling issues with the created WordPress theme. The user uploaded an HTML file of the Live Preview within WordPress, which appeared to show the WordPress Customizer interface rather than the actual website preview, indicating a fundamental problem with how the theme is rendering in the WordPress environment.

The AI's diagnosis points to several potential causes: the theme not loading the front-page correctly, CSS not loading properly, missing required pages, and general theme structure issues.

To address these, the AI has taken the following steps:
1.  **Updated **: To properly detect when to show the homepage content (Chat Message 84).
2.  **Added CSS Import Fallback in **: To ensure Tailwind CSS loads correctly (Chat Message 86).
3.  **Added WordPress-Specific CSS Classes to **: To ensure essential styling is applied within the WordPress environment (Chat Message 88).
4.  **Added Utility Classes to **: To include potentially missing utility classes (Chat Message 90).
5.  **Created **: As an alternative approach for the homepage to see if it resolves the rendering issue (Chat Message 92).
6.  **Added Homepage Setting Configuration to **: To automatically set the homepage correctly within WordPress settings (Chat Message 95).
7.  **Attempting Inline CSS Fallback in **: The last action was to add inline styles directly in the header, as a measure to ensure styling works even if external CSS fails (Chat Message 97).

The immediate goal is to make the WordPress theme's visual output match the successfully rendered React preview.
